# odin-recipes

For this project, The Odin Recipes, I worked on the fundamentals of HTML. As this is a recipes page, this naturally allowed me to bring in HTML elements like images and links, as well as ordered and unordered lists. I've learned quite a bit on this porject beyond HTML, such as working with Git, the command terminal and Visual Studio Code. 

For this project, I only utilized HTMl to build for this project, and did not use CSS or JS and I was amazed at how much you can do with just HTML alone. I will be working with CSS and JS in future projects, on my journey through this full stack Javascript course, The Odin Project.
