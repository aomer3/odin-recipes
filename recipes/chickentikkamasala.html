        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 green chile peppers, minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>Half cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>Quarter cup water</li>
        <li>1 tsp garama masala</li>
        <li>Half tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>Half tsp ground tumeric</li>
        <li>Half tsp salt</li>
        <li>Half cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>Half bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the chicken: Combine yogurt, garam masala, paprika, black pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, and coriander in a large bowl. Add chicken strips and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each piece.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook, sirring gently, until lightly toasted and aromatic, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until onion begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add chile peppers, garlic, and ginger; continue to cook and stir until onion is browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, and water; cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes begin to break down, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and salt, then stir in chicken and cream until well combined; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
