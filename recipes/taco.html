    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Crunchy and soft tacos make a great couple. The soft taco, layered with a mixture of refried beans and cheese, act as a cushion to keep the crunchy taco shell, filled with taco meat and toppings, from breaking. It's fun for kids and adults, too! This recipe is versatile and toppings are a matter of preference. We prefer shredded cheese, sour cream, lettuce, hot sauce, and sometimes guacamole. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
